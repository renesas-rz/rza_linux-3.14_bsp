<H2> Section 1: Modifying the RSK board (V1 and V2 boards)</H2>
<PRE>
NOTE!!
If your board is labeled as a "V1" or "V2", then these modifications are needed.

================================================
ENABLE ETHERNET
================================================
To use Ethernet, RSK+RZA1H board configuration must be changed  by modifying link registers.

	R104 : Fit -> Remove
	R105 : Remove -> Fit

Please refer to [6.1.8 Ethernet] of "RZ/A1H Group Renesas Starter Kit+  User's Manual For DS-5" for details. 

The two resistors are right on the corner of the RZ chip between the silk screen text for IC1 and a Tantalum capacitor next to silk screen marking for IC20. 

They are located together – the only two resistors in this area.
Please see "Ethernet_Resistors.png" <A href="Ethernet_Resistors.png">Link</A>

================================================
REMOVE SD CARD DATA LINE PULL DOWN
================================================
During board manufacturing, a 0-Ohm resistor was populated when it was not supposed to be.

Resistor R92 Needs to be removed.

It is located on the bottom of the board near the CN1 card socket.

<H2> Section 2: Make sure your PC has the software it needs to build</H2>
<PRE>
1.Host PC
	Install Ubuntu(12.04LTS or 14.04LTS) into a PC (or Virtual Machine) and ensure it has an Internet connection.
	Please choose the 32-bit install of Ubuntu as the 64-bit version may cause issues when building
	due to the pre-built toolchain.

2.Additional packages
	Install additional packages to the PC by executing following
	commands:

	$ sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools
	$ sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
</PRE>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="S3">
<H2> Section 3: Building</H2>
<PRE>
To build this BSP, please open a terminal window in Linux and change into the base
directory of this BSP. From there, type:

	./build.sh

This will show you your options on what you can build.
For best results, run each build stage one at a time in the order they
appeared in the help message.

For building the Linux kernel, you can choose to build a traditional kernel that
will execute from RAM (uImage) or an XIP kernel that will execute directly from
Flash (xipImage). Since this is an ARM architecture, the "Device Tree Blobs"
will also be built ('dtbs' is added to the end of command line) and also programmed
into your boards.


You may continue to use the build.sh script for individual component development.
For example, to add/remove kernel driver support, you can run:
	$ ./build.sh kernel menuconfig

Or to add more software packages to your root file system:
	$ ./build.sh buildroot menuconfig

To build the minimum RAM version of the XIP kernel, run the following:
	$ ./build.sh kernel rskrza1_xip_min_defconfig
	$ ./build.sh kernel xipImage
	$ ./build.sh kernel dtbs


NOTE: If you've already built a 'uImage', and now you want to build a 'xipImage', you must
first run the following command:
	$ ./build.sh kernel distclean

<A NAME="S4">
<H2> Section 4: How to use the SEGGER JLINK Lite that comes with the RSK to program your board</H2>
<PRE>
Programming the Serial SPI Flash with the Segger JLINK

The RZ/A1 RSK kit comes with a Segger Lite JTAG Adapter. In the directory

	Extra/J-Link_QSPI_Program

are programming scripts to program binary images that you build into on-board serial
flash (Dual SQPI).

Simply copy the resulting binaries from your builds into this directory and rename
them to end in ".bin" (overwritting the existing ones).

The individual binaries from the build.sh process can be found at these locations:

	rskrza1_bsp/output/u-boot-2015.01/u-boot.bin
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/uImage
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/xipImage (for XIP builds)
	rskrza1_bsp/output/linux-3.14/arch/arm/boot/dts/r7s72100-rskrza1.dtb
	rskrza1_bsp/output/buildroot-2014.05/output/images/rootfs.squashfs
	rskrza1_bsp/output/axfs/rootfs.axfs.bin

The J-Link_QSPI_Program directory contains scripts for both Linux and Windows. Both
scripts perform the same operations and display detailed instructions.

	  LINUX: Program_QSPI.sh
	WINDOWS: Program_QSPI.bat

IMPORTANT:
You will need to program multiple binary images to boot the kernel.
Please review the information below:

1 = Program u-boot                 >> Program at least once
2 = Program Device Tree Blob       >> Program at least once
3 = Program Kernel (uImage)        >> If you choose this, don't select #4
4 = Program Kernel (xipImage)      >> If you choose this, don't select #3
5 = Program Rootfs (squashfs)      >> If you choose this, don't select #6
6 = Program Rootfs (axfs)          >> If you choose this, don't select #5
9 = Exit

Example programming/boot sequences:

SDRAM Boot: #1, #2, #3, #5, #9. Then use "=> run s_boot" in u-boot
  XIP Boot: #1, #2, #4, #5, #9. Then use "=> run x_boot" in u-boot
  XIP Boot: #1, #2, #4, #6, #9. Then use "=> run xa_boot" in u-boot


IMPORTANT:
Whenever you program the SPI Flash using this method, you will need to remove
power from the board to reset it (just using the RESET button will not work).
However, you may program multiple images (run the BATCH file multiple times) without
having to power cycle between each program session.

<A NAME="S5">
<H2> Section 5: How to set up your serial port interface between the board and PC</H2>
<PRE>
Serial Port Setup

You will need a serial port connection between the board and the PC.
The RSK board has an USB-to_Serial device already mounted, so you only need
to connect the USB cable that comes with the kit to between connector CN18 and
your PC.

	baudrate    :115200 bps
	data        :     8 bit
	parity      :  none
	stop        :     1 bit
	flow control:  none


Linux:
Linux will already have native support for this USB-to-Serial converter.
It should show up as /dev/ttyACM0. Therefore, you can use it like:

	$ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200

	NOTE: minicom is not pre-installed, so you ahve to do a 'apt-get install minicom'
	NOTE: To close minicom, press Ctrl+A, then 'q'

Windows:
While windows nativly suports a CDC class driver, you will need to point it
to a .INF file. That INF file comes on the RZ/A1 RSK CD.
You can also find it in the BSP in the "Extra" directory.
</PRE>

<A NAME="S6">
<H2> Section 6: How to program in a MAC address into your board.</H2>
<PRE>
Setup MAC Address

This is done in u-boot.

Connect AC adapter and power on the CPU board.
Push space key of the terminal as soon as possible after
power on to stop autoboot.

MAC Address is stored in eeprom(0x08000000 ~ 0x08000007).
First two bytes are 0, and following 6 bytes as MAC Address.

An example of eeprom writing procedure is as follows:

(1) Write

	Ex. MAC Address = 66:55:44:33:22:11
	  * Use MAC address printed on the label on the board.

	=> mm.b 0x08000000
		First 2byte should be set 0.
		ex) 08000000: XX ? 0
		    08000001: XX ? 0
		Set MAC Address.
		and exit to push "." key.
		ex) 08000002: XX ? 66
		    08000003: XX ? 55
		    08000004: XX ? 44
		    08000005: XX ? 33
		    08000006: XX ? 22
		    08000007: XX ? 11
		    08000008: XX ? .
	=> md.b 0x08000000 8
		ex)08000000: 00 00 66 55 44 33 22 11
	=> eeprom write 0x08000000 0 8
		ex)EEPROM @0x50 write: addr 08000000  off 0000  count 8 ... done

(2) Check
	=> eeprom read 0x08000000 0 8
		ex)EEPROM @0x50 read: addr 08000000  off 0000  count 8 ... done
	=> md.b 0x08000000 8
		ex)08000000: 00 00 66 55 44 33 22 11

<H2> Section 7: How to boot the Linux kernel from u-boot</H2>
<PRE>
Linux kernel booting

If all the defaults of this BSP were used to build the images, and you used the JLINK
programming scripts in the Extra directory to program the serial SPI flash, you may
use the follow commands in u-boot to boot your board.


# Boot the uImage kernel image
# The external SDRAM will be used for system memory (default)
# A squashfs file system should be programmed into the QSPI

=> run s_boot


# Boot the xipIamge kernel image
# Kernel will run directly from QUAD SPI Flash and internal chip RAM will used
# for system memory.
# A squashfs file system should be programmed into the QSPI

=> run x_boot

# Boot the xipIamge kernel image
# Kernel will run directly from QUAD SPI Flash and internal chip RAM will used
# for system memory.
# A AXFS file system should be programmed into the QSPI

=> run xa_boot


File system login will be "root" (no password)

<A NAME="S8">
<H2> Section 8: Tracking Upstream Changes</H2>
<PRE>
In between BSP releases, new features and bug fixes are applied and checked into
a public github account. If you would like to set up your BSP build environment so
that you can easily retrive the lastest u-boot and kernel, follow these instructions.


$ git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/rskrza1_bsp.git
$ cd rskrza1_bsp
$ mkdir output
$ cd output
$ git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/linux-3.14.git
$ git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/u-boot-2015.01.git
$ cd ..

Now you can execute ./build.sh as outline in <A href="#S3">Section 3</A>.


To pull in the latest BSP changes:

$ cd output/linux-3.14
$ git pull
$ cd ../..
$ cd output/u-boot-2015.01
$ git pull
$ cd ../..


NOTE: Even though github has a valid SSL certificate, some have mentioned that
git doesn't resolve it correctly. If you cannot git clone correctly, you might
want to try adding "env GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true" before git clone.

Example: 
$ env GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/rskrza1_bsp.git

<A NAME="S9">
<H2> Section 9: Installing J-Link Software for Linux</H2>
<PRE>
These are the instructions for installing the Segger Jlink drivers and utilities for Linux. This example is for a host running a 32-bit Ubuntu (Debian).

Download "Software and documentation pack for Linux V5.00i, DEB Installer 32-bit version" from

	https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html

Installing any later version than V5.00i is OK.

In a command window, install the downloaded file:

	$ sudo dpkg -i jlink_5.0.9_i386.deb

After the install, on a command line you can type "JLink" then hit the 'tab' key on your keyboard to see all the utilities it
installed. You should see something like this:

$ JLink
JLinkDebugger JLinkGDBServer JLinkRTTClient JLinkSWOViewer
JLinkExe JLinkRemoteServer JLinkSTM32
